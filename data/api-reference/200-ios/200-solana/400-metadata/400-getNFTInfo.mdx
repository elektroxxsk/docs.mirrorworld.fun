# `getNFTInfo`
Get NFT info. You need to parse the rawJsonString by yourself, cause SDK don't know what format your NFT is like.

```Swift
MWSDK.Solana.Metadata.getNFTInfo(mint_address: mint_address) {data in
    print(data)
} onFailed: {code, message in
    print("failed  code:\(code),message: \(message ?? "")")
}
```

# `InitSDK`
Before using all APIs of Mirror, you need to init SDK first.
To init sdk, you need to have an API key first, you can get one from [SDK official site](https://app.mirrorworld.fun)

```java
Context context = this;
String apiKey = "your-api-key";
MirrorEnv env = MirrorEnv.DevNet;

MWSDK.InitSDK(context,apiKey,env);
```

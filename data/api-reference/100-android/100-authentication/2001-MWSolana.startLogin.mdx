# `startLogin`
Calling this API would pop up a dialog, user can finish the login flow on it. In this dialog,
the user can login with a third method like google, twitter. Or the user can login with the
email which is registered on our website.
```java
MWSolana.startLogin(new LoginListener() {
    @Override
    public void onLoginSuccess() {
        //todo
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoginFail() {
        //todo
    }
});
```

  # iOS (Swift) Integration Guide

  This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart SDK on iOS (Swift).

  ## 1. Create a Developer Account
  Create a developer account on the [Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun).
  Create project and create an API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to the next step.


  ## 2. Add the Mirror World SDK dependency CocoaPods

  `MirrorWorldSDK` is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
  it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

  ```ruby Podfile
  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
  platform :ios, '10.0'
  use_frameworks!

  target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'MirrorWorldSDK'
  end
  ```

  ## 3. Install `MirrorWorldSDK` using CocoaPods
  Run the following command to install the SDK on your project:

  ```sh
  pod install
  ```

  ---
  ## 4. Configuring `URLScheme` in `info.plist`
  The Mirror World iOS SDK uses a custom SDK to pass information into the SDK client. In order to enable this
  functionality, you need to configure `UrlScheme(mwsdk)` in your project.

  Set `UrlScheme` in the `info.plist` file of your project: `mwsdk` like this:

  ![`info.plist`](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirrorworld-sdk-ios/blob/master/Example/MirrorWorldSDK/infoplist-UrlScheme-desc.png?raw=true)

  ---
  ## 5. Usage

  Import and initialize the Mirror World SDK in the `AppDelegate`.

  ```swift AppDelegate.swift
  import MirrorWorldSDK

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

      MWSDK.initSDK(env: .StagingDevNet, apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY")
      // ---------
      return true
  }

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleOpen url: URL) -> Bool {

      MirrorWorldSDK.share.handleOpen(url: url)
      return true
  }

  ```

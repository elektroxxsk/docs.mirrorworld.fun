  # Rust Integration Guide

  This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart SDK on Rust.

  ## 1. Create a Developer Account
  Create a developer account on the [Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). Create project and create an API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to the next one.


  ## 2. Install dependencies

  Add the `mirrorworld-sdk-rust` to your `Cargo.toml`. Alternativly you can run
  `cargo add mirrorworld-sdk-rust`.

  ```sh shell.sh
  cargo add mirrorworld-sdk-rust
  ```
  ---

  ## 3. Import the SDK in your file
  Import the installed SDK into your file and start building!

  ```rust main.rs
  // Import all modules
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::*;

  // Or you may import specific methods
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::{
    // ...
    login_with_email,
    // ...
  };
  ```

  ---

  ### Marketplace Module initialization

  When developing with the Marketplace service on the Mirror World Rust SDK,
  you need to create an instance of the `Marketplace` interface to access these methods.

  Here's an example of how the `Marketplace` is instantiated.

  > Always make sure you have an instance of the `Marketplace` in your
  > context before invoking the marketplace service methods.

  ```rust marketplace.rs
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::{ marketplace::Marketplace, NetEnv };
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::marketplace::GeneralPayload;

  fn main() {
    let APIKEY: &str = "SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY"; // Can be gotten from the developer dashboard
    let ACCESS_TOKEN: &str = "USER_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN"; // Current user's auth token

    let marketplace =  Marketplace::new(KEY.to_string(), NetEnv::DEVNET, TOKEN.to_string());
  }

  ```

  ## Going Further
  Great! At this point you're pretty much ready to start doing building with the
  Rust SDK for Mirror World. There are a few things you can do to proceed from here:

  - Explore the [Full Rust API Reference](/api-reference/rust) to learn more.
  - Looking for inspiration? Take a look at our [Guides](/guides) or see what builders are building in the [Showcase](/showcase).

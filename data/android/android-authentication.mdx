# Authentication Tips

## User login with different social accounts.

Every kind of social account login will provide a new wallet for users. These wallets are not the same.

## Login invalidation

Token saved locally by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, the developer should check his authentication every time. If the token is invalidated, we should guild users to login again.
For example, you can follow the logic like this:

```java
MirrorSDK.getInstance().CheckAuthenticated(new BoolListener() {
    @Override
    public void onBool(boolean boolValue) {
        boolean isLoggedIn = boolValue;
        if(isLoggedIn){
            //todo: enter content directly
        }else {
            //todo: show a button leading the user to login.
        }
    }
});
```

# Introduction

The Mirror World Smart SDK is a cross-platform SDK that provides a simple,
declarative API interface for building Mobile and Web dApps in a multi-chain
context.

We built Mirror World to accelerate the adoption of decentralized technologies.
At present there are a lot of challenges faced with building decentralized
applications:

- **For users**, the _onboarding process is severely complex_ - requiring new
  user to install various wallet extensions and learn about private key
  management before they even interact with the dApp is a taxing effort.
- **For developers**, it is no hidden secret that _building Web 3 applications
  is also significantly complex_. The average developer will not only have to
  have proficiency both at the protocol level for blockchain development, they
  must also possess application level proficiency to build a successful dApps to
  their users. This increases the time to market.

For individuals/teams with limited time and resources, this effort would be
better spent improving their core product and iterating quickly for their users.

Therefore, we built the Mirror World Smart SDK to make it easy for developers
to:

- **Onboard new Web3 users with one click.** - No more seed-phrases! Mirror
  World's Smart Auth provides authentication with methods your users are already
  familiar with.
- **Fast-track your Web3 development time.** - The Mirror World API provides a
  simple, yet powerful and declarative interface for interacting with the chain.
- **Target multiple platforms** - The Mirror World Smart SDK is cross-platform.
  Build for the Web. Build for Mobile. Build with speed.

## Our open-source initiative

We also seek to foster an open-source friendly community where builders can
contribute to the tools we create and be rewarded for their significant
contributions to the Mirror World development ecosystem.

# Multi-chain Support
We started our Mirror World Smart SDK primary on [Solana](https://solana.com) because of its low fees, high TPS and growing community to
support the games ecosystems. We do however, plan to support multiple chains in the near future.

> **We are currently building EVM support, to be released in Q1/2023**

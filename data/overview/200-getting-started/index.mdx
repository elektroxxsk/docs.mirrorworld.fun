# Getting Started (~5 mins)

Welcome to Mirror World! If you are new to the Mirror World SDK, don't worry, in
the next tutorials, we will show you how to use and play with our product.

## What is the Developer Dashboard?

The Developer dashboard is where you can manage your projects and API keys, as
well as get real-time metrics for projects. To start interacting with our SDK,
you need to launch your projects on our dashboard platform to get some basic
access permission codes (API keys, Client IDs, etc.).

## Create an account

To get started, visit <span onClick = {()=> {
window.mixgather.event("developer_dashboard");
}}>[Create a developer account](https://app.mirrorworld.fun)</span>. You will need this account to access
all the features we provided. If you encounter any issues with your account, you
can <span onClick = {() => {window.mixgather.event("contact_us");}}>[contact us](mailto:sdk@mirrorworld.fun)</span> or
join our<span onClick={() => {window.mixgather.event("join_telegram")}}> [Discord](https://mirrorworld.fun/discord)</span> and<span onClick={() =>{window.mixgather.event("join_discord")}} > [Telegram](https://mirrorworld.fun/telegram)</span> communities to report to our team directly.

## Create your project

Once you've signed in to the dashboard, you will be directed to our home page,
which contains some resources that help you better understand how to use our SDK
as well as find some support during the development process.

## Managing your application credentials

Every project is created with 3 credentials that you will use when developing
with Mirror World:

1. **API Key** - Authorizes a client to access the Mirror World API. Without it,
no requests can be authorized. A single project can have multiple API Keys.
You can create as many as you need per project. If one API keys is
compromised, you can delete it from your app, and create a new one for your
project without affecting the operation of your project.
2. **Client ID** - The Client ID can be used to publicly identify your project.
We use this key internally to identify which project a specific request
belongs.
3. **Client Secret** - A sensitive credential that the project owner/developer
will use to verify certain claims about their project on our Authentication
services. For example, if your project authenticates with Mirror World, and
hopes to access user data on your API, we will use this secret to verify the
claims your back end submits via the verification endpoint.

You will find these credentials on the Project Page on the dashboard.

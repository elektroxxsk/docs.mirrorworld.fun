# Smart Authentication

Smart Auth enables free, seamless, one-click authentication - onboarding million of Web3 users with fraction of the cost.
- **Free forever** - Onboarding users is just the first step to building a successful dApp. So we provide this service free of charge.
- **Go mainstream** - Supports mainstream social authentication providers that users are familiar with (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Apple, e.t.c.)
- **Self-custody wallet support** - Want to use MetaMask or Phantom to authenticate? No problem! You can still authenticate your users with self-custody wallets on Mirror World.

# Smart Wallet

## What does Smart Wallet do?

Smart Wallet is used to send, receive and display tokens and NFTs, and enables
one-click payment integration for developers, solves the issue of geographic
coverage.

## What are the features of Smart Wallet?

- **Non-custodial MPC Wallet** - When users signup on Mirror World, we generate
  a non-custodial wallet (MPC-TSS) for them. The user's wallet is the same
  across dApps.
- **Plug N' Play Wallet UI** - The Mirror World Smart SDK provides a
  customizable Wallet UI for your users so you can still display the wallet UI
  to your users.
- **Fiat-to-crypto on ramp in 200+ geographies with instant payments** - Buy
  crypto from anywhere. No need to do a two-month-long KYB process so users can
  buy tokens for your dApp. (We got you!)

In [Mirrors Jump](/showcase/games/mirrors-jump), we use Smart Wallet, which
helps users to make cryptocurrency purchases, trade cryptocurrency, and earn
rewards directly in the game.

Your players, without having to understand a lot of complicated terms, without
having to store private key, and without having to worry about the security of
their assets, will be able to purchase cryptocurrency with their credit card and
then use and trade it in the game.

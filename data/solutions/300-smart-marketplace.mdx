## Technical Structure
Behind the scenes, Mirror World uses the widely supported [Seaport Protocol](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) to orchestrate marketplace listings and transactions.

Seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. Each listing contains an arbitrary number of items that the offerer is willing to give (the "offer") along with an arbitrary number of items that must be received along with their respective receivers (the "consideration").

## How did we use Smart Marketplace?

| <video style={{ maxWidth: "250px", height: "auto", margin: "0 auto" }} src="https://market-assets.mirrorworld.fun/landingPage/Key%20Features/demo/demo3.mp4" poster="https://market-assets.mirrorworld.fun/first/3.png" autoPlay={true} muted={true} preload="auto" loop={true} /> | In [Mirrors Jump](/showcase/games/mirrors-jump), we used the Smart Marketplace to quickly build our own in-game marketplace where players can sell or buy their favorite NFTs. The core NFTs in Mirrors Jump are characters, so players can sell these character NFTs of varying rarity on the marketplace at different prices. <br /><br /> Developers can personalize their own marketplace, for example, they can set which NFT collections to display and the commission of the platform. Allowing players to exchange in-game items freely, this not only adds interesting gameplay for players, but also allows developers to make some profit. |

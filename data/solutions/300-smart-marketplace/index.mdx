## How did we use Smart Marketplace?

The core NFTs in Mirrors Jump are characters, so players can sell these character NFTs of varying rarity on the marketplace at different prices. <br /><br /> Developers can personalize their own marketplace, for example, they can set which NFT collections to display and the commission of the platform. Allowing players to exchange in-game items freely, this not only adds interesting gameplay for players, but also allows developers to make some profit. |

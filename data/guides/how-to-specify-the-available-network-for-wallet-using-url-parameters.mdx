In this article, you will learn how to control the network list available for a wallet by manipulating parameters in the URL.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started or go
through this guide for a proper explanation.

## Create UI Widget URL

Base URL:

```bash
http://auth-next.mirrorworld.fun/
```

Now letâ€™s get straight into building! All you need to do is add the network name you want to control to the "network" parameter in the URL.

| URL Param         | Required? | Sample            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `network`         | `No`     | `<solana,bnb,polygon,ethereum>` |

```bash
https://auth-next.mirrorworld.fun?network=solana,bnb
```

Fiat on-ramp service allows users to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. In MirrorWorld, we partner with third-party on-ramp providers to provides a seamless experience to use all major payment methods, including debit and credit card, local bank transfers, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started or go
through this guide for a proper explanation.


## Get On-Ramp UI Widget URL
You can get on-ramp provider's UI widget URL by making a call to the MirrorWorld backend.
```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://api.mirrorworld.fun/v2/solana/devnet/wallet/on_ramp/get_url?email=<USER_EMAIL>&walletAddress=<RECEIVER_PUBLICK_ADDRESS>&currencyCode=<CRYPTO_CURRENCY_TICKER>' \
--header 'x-api-key: <PROJECT_API_KEY>'
````

The response contains the UI widget URL:
```bash
https://buy-sandbox.moonpay.com/?apiKey=<MOONPAY_API_KEY>&&currencyCode=<CRYPTO_CURRENCY_TICKER>&walletAddress=<RECEIVER_PUBLICK_ADDRESS>&email=<USER_EMAIL>&signature=1Mqv9xm6vzd%2BY40MF%2FHeVqHSx%2FJ9w5cB1%2
````

### Open UI Widget URL

Once you get the URL, you can open it in your app (e.g. webview, iframe). The on-ramp provider will guide the user to finish the purchase process, including typing in payment information and KYC if needed.

This article aims to provide an understanding of what SAK is, how to generate
one, and its comparison with User JWT Tokens. Additionally, we'll explore the
API endpoints that require the use of a SAK, focusing on actions within an NFT
(Non-Fungible Token) ecosystem.

## What’s SAK?

Secret Access Key (SAK) is a confidential piece of information used to
authenticate and authorize developers' access to specific services, platforms,
or APIs. It serves as a secure token that validates the identity of the
developer and allows them to perform certain actions or retrieve data from the
associated service. SAKs are particularly prevalent in scenarios where more
robust access control is required beyond what standard API tokens or user
credentials can offer.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started.

## How to Generate SAK

- Navigate to your dashboard( https://app.mirrorworld.fun/dashboard ) and click
  on your profile at the top right corner.

-[] On the modal that pops up, click on the Add button.

-[] Lastly and also very important, copy the just created Access key because you
won’t be able to see it once you close teh modal.

You can also modify the URL with custom data using any of the above parameters,
for example, Let's say I want the initial fiat amount on the widget to be 500
then you can modify the URL to like this:

## SAK vs User JWT Tokens
While both SAKs and User JWT Tokens are authentication mechanisms, they serve different purposes. SAKs are typically used by developers to access APIs and perform administrative tasks, making them suited for server-to-server interactions. On the other hand, User JWT Tokens are generated upon user authentication and are commonly used to authorize user-specific actions and data retrieval. The distinction lies in the scope and purpose of their usage.

## API Endpoints that Requires SAK
There are several API endpoints that require SAK, below is a list of some of them


> - Add collection to tracked collections
> - Mint a new NFT Collection
> - Update NFT on the collection
> - Mint NFT on the collection

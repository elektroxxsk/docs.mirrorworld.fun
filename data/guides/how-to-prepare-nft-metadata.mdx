## What is NFT metadata

NFT Metadata essentially stores information about your NFTs. They may include
essential properties of the NFT such as its name, total supply and transaction
history.

NFT metadata usually comes in `json` format and describes the characteristics
and properties of the NFT.

## The ERC115 metadata standard

Before we learn how to prepare our metadata, we need to talk about the ERC115
metadata standard.

The ERC115 metadata standard is a popular standard for creating NFT metadata.
This is the metadata standard enforced by Mirror World and on Solana NFTs as
well. As long as your metadata exists on Solana, it is expected to conform to
the
[ERC-1155 metadata schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#metadata).
The ERC115 standard is backwards compatible with ERC-721 and is generally
well-supported by various wallets and marketplaces.

> Only metadata that conforms to the ERC-1155 metadata standard is accepted on
> Mirrorworld.

## Metadata properties

An NFT metadata may contain the following properties in it:

- `name`: Name of the asset.
- `symbol`: Symbol of the asset.
- `description`: Description of the asset.
- `image`: URI pointing to the asset's logo.
- `animation_url` (optional): URI pointing to the asset's animation.
- `external_url`: URI pointing to an external URL defining the asset â€” e.g. the
  game's main site.
- `attributes`: Array of attributes defining the characteristics of the asset.

Let's look at how to prepare metadata for your NFT

## How to prepare Metadata for NFT

Preparing the metadata for your NFT is relatively straightforward. You will need
to create a `json` file that contains all the relevant information about your
NFT as seen above.

Here's an example of what your `json` file would look like:

**metadata.json**

```json
{
  "name": "Smart Platform by Mirror World",
  "symbol": "SPMW",
  "description": "Smart Platform by Mirror World offers multi-chain social authentication, MPC wallet solutions, and in-app marketplace solutions, all with 0 upfront cost.",
  "image": "https://arweave.net/26YdhY_eAzv26YdhY1uu9uiA3nmDZYwP8MwZAultcE?ext=jpeg",
  "animation_url": "https://arweave.net/ZAultcE_eAzv26YdhY1uu9uiA3nmDZYwP8MwuiA3nm?ext=glb",
  "external_url": "https://example.com",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "trait1",
      "value": "value1"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "trait2",
      "value": "value2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Storing your metadata

Once you have prepared the metadata `json` file for your NFT, you can make it
into a metadata `json` URL. This URL can then be used to easily access the
metadata `json` file associated with the NFT.

To create the metadata `json` URL, you will first need to upload the `json` file
to an IPFS service like Arweave.

Once the `json` file is uploaded, you will need to obtain the download link for
the `json` file. This link is the metadata `json` URL.

In this guide, we're going to take it a step further and learn how to create an
NFT marketplace storefront on Solana using the Mirror World Smart SDK. Let's get
into it

## What is a Storefront

An NFT marketplace storefront serves as a user interface for your users to buy
and sell NFTs on your marketplace. A marketplace can exist without a storefront
but a storefront can't exist without a marketplace.

> It is only after creating a marketplace that you'll be ready to create a
> storefront.

### 1. Clone Storefront UI Template Repository

Mirror World provides a
[UI template](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/marketplace-storefront)
that you can easily clone to set up your storefront.

Run the following command in your terminal to get started:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mirrorworld-universe/marketplace-storefront.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

After cloning the template, you can now install all its dependencies. You'll be
required to choose the version of the SDK you want to install. You should choose
the latest version which will be the first option.

```bash
#run these to install dependencies

yarn install

#or

npm install
```

### 3. Setup storefront `userConfig.json` variables.

You'll need to edit the `userConfig.json` file that exists in the root of your
project folder. The `userConfig.json` file basically provides more information
about your storefront.

Download your `userConfig.json` from your project's marketplace on
the [developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun/). It should look
something like the example below:

```js
{
  // Array of collection addresses
  "collections": ["COLLECTION_ADDRESS"],

  // API Key
  "xApiKey": "YOUR_UNIQUE_API_KEY",

  // Marketplace commission fee in percentage
  "serviceFee": 4.25,

  // Marketplace storefront currency
  "currencyOption": "SOL",

  // Storefront name
  "name": "MY_AWESOME_STOREFRONT",

  // Storefront Logo URL
  "logo": "",

  // Storefront Network
  "network": "mainnet"
}
```

### 4. Run dev server

You can now run your development server to view your storefront! Run `yarn dev`
and open the browser on `http://localhost:3000` to preview your storefront.

### 5. Show the World!

Congrats! You successfully created a marketplace storefront. You may go ahead
and deploy your application using
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.dev/).

## Conclusion

Thanks to the MIrror World Smart SDK, creating marketplace storefronts to sell
your digital collectibles is really simple and straightforward. To reiterate,
you'll only be able to create a storefront after you've created a marketplace,

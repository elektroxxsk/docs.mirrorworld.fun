This guide will enable you to create an NFT Marketplace using the Mirror World
Smart SDK.

> The Marketplace on Mirror World is currently available on Solana Mainnet and
> Devnet.

## Creating your Marketplace

1. On the <span onClick = {()=> window.mixgather.event("developer_dashboard")}>[Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun)</span>,
under the projects tab, create a Marketplace for your project by completing
the prompts.
2. Include the collections you would like to list on your marketplace.

## Creating the Storefront

After creating the Marketplace on the Developer Dashboard, you're ready to
create a storefront. A storefront is a user interface that your users will use
to buy and sell NFTs on your Marketplace. The storefront serves as the UI for
your marketplace core.

### Storefront creation guide

### 1. Clone Storefront UI Template Repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mirrorworld-universe/marketplace-storefront.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

### 3. Setup storefront `userConfig.json` variables.

Download your `userConfig.json` from your project's Marketplace on the [developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). It should look something like the example below:

```json
{
  // Array of collection addresses
  "collections": ["DUuMbpmH3oiREntViXfGZhrLMbVcYBwGeBa4Wn9X8QfM"],
  // API Key
  "xApiKey": "mw_testAmRKdRbBsBbIAw3CeMqS9GORmcG5BRUCU4D",
  // Marketplace commission fee in percentage
  "serviceFee": 4.25,
  // Marketplace storefront currency
  "currencyOption": "SOL",
  // Storefront name
  "name": "Mirrors Jump",
  // Storefront Logo URL
  "logo": "",
  // Storefront Network
  "network": "mainnet"
}
```

### 4. Run dev server

```shell
yarn dev
```

Open the browser on `http://localhost:3000` to preview your storefront.

## Getting Started

In this article, you’re going to learn how to integrate a service that enables
your users to buy cryptocurrencies using the method they are already used to
such as credit and debit cards. 

Token On-Ramp is the process of buying crypto
with fiat currency using a credit, debit card or even by making a transfer. This
is a game changer in web3 right now because it reduces the friction of
onboarding web3 native into web3.

## Create UI Widget URL

Base URL:

```bash
http://onramp.mirrorworld.fun/
```

Now let’s get straight into building! The only thing you need to do is to add
the base URL to your iframe or webview on mobile, the on-ramp provider will
guide you on how to complete your purchase.

The Mirror World Smart SDK not only helps you create dedicated Marketplaces for
your NFTs and NFT collections, but it also equips you with different ways to
perform transactions in the marketplace.

In this guide, we’ll look at the different marketplace transactions that you can
make using the Mirror World Smart SDK.

## Mirror World Smart SDK Marketplace Transactions

### 1. Marketplace Methods

You can create, update, and query marketplaces using the Mirror World Smart SDK.
The SDK provides methods that make setting up your very own marketplace
seamless. Go through this comprehensive guide on
[how to create NFT Marketplaces](https://docs.mirrorworld.fun/guides/how-to-create-nft-marketplace)
using the SDK to learn more.

### 2. NFT Transaction Methods

The Mirror World Smart SDK has a number of methods that allow you to manage your
NFTs.

Let’s look at some of these methods and what they do:

- **list NFT:** This is used to list an NFT on the marketplace.

```jsx
// how to list an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.listNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
})
```

- **update NFT listing:** You may update NFT listing details on the marketplace.
  e.g the price of the NFT.

```jsx
// how to update an NFT listing on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.updateNFTListing({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
})
```

- **cancel NFT listing:** You may also cancel an NFT listing.

```jsx
// how to cancel an NFT listing on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.cancelNFTListing({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
})
```

- **buy NFT:** This can be used to purchase an NFT on the Mirror World
  marketplace.

```jsx
// how to list buy an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.buyNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
})
```

- **transfer NFT:** If you would like to transfer an NFT from a holder's wallet
  to another address.

```jsx
// how to transfer an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.transferNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  recipientAddress: `C64RkD2jnvrFF8mi9FUBwfhNHuuiPuRMzCLRSWcyJKUG`,
})
```

### 3. Fetch NFTs

There could be a number of reasons why you may want to fetch an NFT or a list of
NFTs. It could be to display them in a dApp or list them on a marketplace.
Whatever the reason, the Mirror World Smart SDK provides a variety of ways in
which you can successfully fetch these NFTs and work with them.

Here are the different ways you may fetch an NFT:

- **by Mint Address:** by providing a mint address or list of mint addresses,
  you can retrieve all the NFTs associated with the provided mint address(es)

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by mint address using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByMintAddresses({
  mintAddresses: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one mint address or a list of mint addresses
  limit: 20, // page size
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

- **by Creator Address or Owner:** similarly, you can fetch a list of NFTs using
  the creator address(es)

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by creator address using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByCreatorAddresses({
  creatorAddresses: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one creator address or a list of creator addresses
  limit: 20, // page size
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

- **by Update Authorities:** update authorities are what identify the owner of
  an NFT and allow them to be able to perform certain upgrades and mutate the
  state of the NFT. You may fetch NFTs using the update authority of that NFT.

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by update authorities using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByUpdateAuthorities({
  updateAuthorities: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one update authority or a list of update authorities
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

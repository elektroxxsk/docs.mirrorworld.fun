The Mirror World Smart SDK not only helps you create dedicated Marketplaces for
your NFTs and NFT collections, but it also equips you with different ways to
perform transactions in the marketplace.

In this guide, we'll look at the different marketplace transactions that you can
make using the Mirror World Smart SDK.

### Pre-requisites
1. You have created and minted your NFT collection and minted NFTs into it. If you haven't already done this, please follow this guide to [Creating NFT collections](/guides/how-to-create-solana-nft-collection)
2. You have created your NFT Marketplace and have the auctionhouse address for your marketplace. This address uniquely identifies your marketplace on teh blockchain. If you do not yet have an auction house address, please follow this guide on [how to create NFT Marketplaces](https://docs.mirrorworld.fun/guides/how-to-create-nft-marketplace)
3. Some familiarity with JavaScript and React.js.

Once you meet the above 3 criterion, you are ready to continue with orchestrating your very own NFT marketplace with Mirror World.


## Mirror World Smart SDK Marketplace Transactions

### 1. Marketplace Methods

You can create, update, and query marketplaces using the Mirror World Smart SDK.
The SDK provides methods that make setting up your very own marketplace
seamless.

> After creating you marketplace, please take note of the `auctionHouse` address returned from the API or displayed to you on the dashboard. We shall use this in the rest of the guide.

### 2. NFT Transaction Methods

The Mirror World Smart SDK has a number of methods that allow you to manage your
NFTs.

Let's look at some of these methods and what they do:

- **list NFT:** This is used to list an NFT on the marketplace for other users to buy. Replace the `mintAddress` and the `auctionHouse` address with your own addresses.

```jsx
// how to list an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.listNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
  auctionHouse: "YOUR_AUCTION_HOUSE_ADDRESS" // Replace this!
})
```

- **update NFT listing:** You may update NFT listing details on the marketplace.
  e.g the price of the NFT. Replace the `mintAddress` and the `auctionHouse` address with your own addresses.

```jsx
// how to update an NFT listing on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.updateNFTListing({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
  auctionHouse: "YOUR_AUCTION_HOUSE_ADDRESS" // Replace this!
})
```

- **cancel NFT listing:** You may also cancel an NFT listing. Replace the `mintAddress` and the `auctionHouse` address with your own addresses.

```jsx
// how to cancel an NFT listing on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.cancelNFTListing({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
  auctionHouse: "YOUR_AUCTION_HOUSE_ADDRESS" // Replace this!
})
```

- **buy NFT:** This can be used to purchase an NFT on the Mirror World
  marketplace.  Replace the `mintAddress` and the `auctionHouse` address with your own addresses.

```jsx
// how to list buy an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.buyNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  price: 2, // Amount in SOL
  auctionHouse: "YOUR_AUCTION_HOUSE_ADDRESS" // Replace this!
})
```

- **transfer NFT:** If you would like to transfer an NFT from a holder's wallet
  to another address.

```jsx
// how to transfer an NFT on a marketplace using the Mirror World JS SDK

const listing = await mirrorworld.transferNFT({
  mintAddress: `Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`,
  recipientAddress: `C64RkD2jnvrFF8mi9FUBwfhNHuuiPuRMzCLRSWcyJKUG`,
})
```

### 3. Fetching NFT data

There could be a number of reasons why you may want to fetch an NFT or a list of
NFTs. It could be to display them in a dApp or list them on a marketplace for your users.
Whatever the reason, the Mirror World Smart SDK provides a variety of ways in
which you can successfully fetch these NFTs and work with them.

Here are the different ways you may fetch an NFT:

- **by Mint Address:** by providing a mint address or list of mint addresses,
  you can retrieve all the NFTs associated with the provided mint address(es)

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by mint address using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByMintAddresses({
  mintAddresses: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one mint address or a list of mint addresses
  limit: 20, // page size
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

- **by Creator Address or Owner:** similarly, you can fetch a list of NFTs using
  the creator address(es)

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by creator address using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByCreatorAddresses({
  creatorAddresses: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one creator address or a list of creator addresses
  limit: 20, // page size
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

- **by Update Authorities:** update authorities is the public key that has the ability to perform certain upgrades and mutate the
  state of the NFT. You may fetch NFTs using the update authority of that NFT.

```jsx
//how to fetch NFTs by update authorities using the Mirror World JS SDK

const nftsQueryResult = await mirrorworld.fetchNFTsByUpdateAuthorities({
  updateAuthorities: [`Hc2My3GQCQTXTjV34Pi1pQGYUeckT1mEcMRiZZaH7Ydr`], // can take one update authority or a list of update authorities
  offset: 0, // page number
})
```

## What's Next

It requires little effort and is relatively easier to start performing marketplace
transactions with the Mirror World Smart SDK. From creating a marketplace to
listing an NFT on that marketplace, there are a lot of options available to you
as a developer to start building your next killer dApp. Check out the
[documentation](https://docs.mirrorworld.fun/) along with the API reference for
the framework of your choice to learn more and fully utilize the SDK.

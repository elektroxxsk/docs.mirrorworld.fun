An NFT Collection is made up of a variety of several unique NFTs. Usually, NFT
collections may consist of various NFTs that share some similar characteristics
with slight variations across each individual token. For GameFi, NFTs are
important assets for players, which allows players to actually own the assets
and help the project achieve co-creation. For SocialFi, NFTs can be used as
status symbols or rewards to be given to social users.

Whatever it is, creating your own NFT collection is a big step in your NFT
journey. In this guide, we're going to learn how to create NFT Collections on
Solana with the Mirror World SDK.

> 💡 **Why do you need an NFT collection?**
>
> NFT collection is the classification of digital assets and is usually used to
> manage different series of NFTs. For example, for GameFi, weapons can be
> divided into different NFT collections depending on their rarity, and each NFT
> collection maintains a separate floor price.

## Getting Started

To create an NFT collection, make sure you already have a Mirror World developer
account. A developer account grants you access to numerous features that can
help you build on Mirror World and it can be created within seconds. If you do
not yet have an account, head over
to [https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login](https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login)
to get started. You'll be redirected to the Mirror World dashboard after
successfully signing up.

## Create a Project

Creating a project is a necessary step in your NFT collection creation process.
A project is the foundation for developing with Mirror World. Every project is
created with three major credentials:

1. **API Key:** Used to authorize a client to access the Mirror World API.
2. **Client ID:** Used to publicly identify your project.
3. **Client Secret:** Sensitive credential that the project owner/developer will
   use to verify certain claims about their project on our Authentication
   services.

These credentials can be found on the Mirror World developer dashboard within
the project.

## Create your NFT collection

1. Create from dashboard

Using the developer dashboard is the fastest and easiest way to get started
creating your NFT collection. Select the project you want to build and click on
the “NFT Collection” tab.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

You'll be redirected to the Collections page. Click on the "Create" button to
create a new collection. You'll be redirected to a pop-up page asking you for
more information about your collection. Please make sure to fill in every field
with the appropriate information. Modifying will require additional gas fees.
Creating a collection requires 0.01-0.02 SOL.

> 💡 Tip:
>
> 1. If you are building your collection on Devnet and don't have enough test
>    tokens, you can click “Airdrop Test Token” to get some test SOL in your
>    account.
> 2. If you are building your collection on Mainnet and don't have enough
>    tokens, you can click “Buy SOL” to purchase tokens to your account or
>    transfer them from your funding wallet.

You will need to provide the following information:

1. Create using the Mirror World API

There's also the option to use our API in creating your collection. All you need
to do is call the `createVerifiedCollection` method:

As you can see, from its name, `createVerifiedCollection` helps you create a
verified NFT collection. Verified collections help others know that the NFTs
come from an authentic source. This is necessary especially if you intend to
make money off of your NFTs as collectors tend to only buy from collections that
are verified.

The Mirror World API helps in simplifying the verification process significantly
as seen in the code below:

Example.tsx:

```tsx
const collection = await mirrorworld.createVerifiedCollection({
  name: "COLLECTION_NAME",
  symbol: "COLLECTION_SYMBOL",
  metadataUri:
    "https://metadata-assets.mirrorworld.fun/sdk/metadata_json/mirror_sdk.json",
})

// Returns `IVerifiedCollection`
export interface IVerifiedCollection {
  mint_address: string
  url: string
  update_authority: string
  creator_address: string
  name: string
  symbol: string
  collection?: null
  signature: string
  status: string
}
```

_Remember, you need to have set up a project and configured your app to use its
API keys before you can successfully call this and other methods._

## Mint your first NFT

Congratulations! You already know how to create your NFT collection. Let's try
to mint an NFT into that collection.

1. Mint NFT from dashboard After you create the NFT collection, click “Mint NFT”
   button and provide your NFT metadata Json URL. Mint an NFT requires 0.01-0.02
   SOL. -

After successfully minting your NFTs, you can view them at
[https://explorer.solana.com/](https://explorer.solana.com/). Or you can check
through our Dashboard by clicking “Account” and clicking “Wallet”, you will also
be directed to your wallet address page on the Solana Explorer. Click on the

## How to mint NFTs in your Game?

### What is an NFT?

NFT, or non-fungible token, is a type of cryptographic token that represents a
unique digital asset. Unlike fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and have
the same value, non-fungible tokens are unique and cannot be replaced or
exchanged for other tokens. NFTs are often used to represent collectible items,
digital art, and other digital assets that are unique and have value.

### Why turn your game assets into NFT?

There are several reasons why game developers and players might want to turn
their game assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Some of the main benefits of
using NFTs for game assets include:

1. **Ownership** : NFTs allow players to own their game assets in a verifiable
   and transparent way. This can give players a sense of ownership and control
   over their assets, and it can prevent issues like theft or fraud.

2. **Trading** : NFTs can be easily traded and exchanged, allowing players to
   buy and sell their game assets on various online marketplaces. This can
   create new opportunities for players to monetize their assets and make a
   profit.

3. **Scarcity** : NFTs can be used to create scarcity around game assets, which
   can increase their value and appeal to players. For example, developers can
   create limited edition items or unique collectibles that can only be obtained
   through certain methods, such as special events or in-game challenges.

4. **Integration** : NFTs can be easily integrated into existing game systems
   and platforms, allowing players to use their assets in different ways. For
   example, NFTs can be used as in-game currency, as items to be used in the
   game, or as part of the game's ecosystem.

Overall, turning game assets into NFTs can provide many benefits for both game
developers and players, and it is likely to become an increasingly popular trend
in the gaming industry.

### Scenarios in Mirrors Jump

In Mirrors Jump, we have 5 different types of NFTs, mainly differentiated by the
type of character:

| ![](/docs/images/mj/t1.png) | ![](/docs/images/mj/t2.png) | ![](/docs/images/mj/t3.png) | ![](/docs/images/mj/t4.png) | ![](/docs/images/mj/t5.png) |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |

| ![screen-shot](/docs/images/mj/demo4-2-1.gif) | In the design of Mirrors Jump, we give each player a free character, which can then be Minted into NFT. This is the process of turning a game asset into an NFT in Mirrors Jump. |

#### Metadata

NFT metadata is information that is associated with a non-fungible token (NFT).
This information is typically stored in the blockchain and is accessible to
anyone who holds or has access to the NFT.

**NFT metadata can include various types of information, such as the name and
description of the asset, the date and time it was created, the creator's name
and address, and any other relevant information**. NFT metadata is important
because it provides context and information about the NFT and the asset it
represents. It can help users understand the value and significance of the NFT,
and it can be used for various purposes, such as verifying the authenticity of
the NFT or tracking its history and ownership.

For example, the NFT metadata information in Mirrors Jump:

```json
{
  "name": "Mirrors Jump #1",
  "symbol": "MJNFT",
  "description": "Mirrors Jump is our tribute to Doodle Jump, powered by Mirror World SDK. We hope that this game will help players to better understand the fun aspects of Web3 games and help developers to better understand how to use the Mirror World SDK.",
  "image": "http://metadata-assets.mirrorworld.fun/mirror_jump/docs/images/Rare_Pirate Captain.png",
  "seller_fee_basis_points": 425,
  "collection": {
    "name": "Mirrors Jump NFT",
    "family": "Mirrors Jump NFT"
  },
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Rarity",
      "value": "Rare"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Type",
      "value": "Pirate Captain"
    }
  ]
}
```

   Metadata JSON URL.
5. Init your SDK with adding MirrorSDK prefab, you can follow the documentation
   here: [InitWithPrefab](/integration/unity#manual-configuration-with-prefab)
6. Let users login with the following code:

```csharp
MirrorSDK.StartLogin((loginResponse)=>
{
    UserResponse userInfo = loginResponse.user;
    //todo
});
```

7. Mint NFT and transfer tokens with the following code

```csharp
string collection = "You can get this collection address from your dashboard";
string name = "this string will not be displayed to the user, you can define it as you wish";
string symbol = "this string will not be displayed to the user, you can define it as you wish";
string nftJsonUrl = "You need to upload your nft config and get this";
string mintID = "A client ID which you can generate it as your wish to identify which NFT is minting. If you use this id more than once to mint a NFT, you will not pass."
string toWalletAddress = "Which wallet you want to receive tokens";
double amountSol = 0.1;

Action approveAction = ()=>{
	Debug.Log("Your operation is approved, now minting start...");
}
Action resultAction = (response)=>{
	if (response.status == "success")
	{
		//todo: minting is success
	}
	else
	{
		//todo: minting is failed
		Debug.Log("failed reason is:" + response.message);
	}
}

MirrorSDK.MintNFT(GlobalDef.ParentCollectionMainNet, name, symbol,nftJsonUrl, Confirmation.Confirmed,mintID,toWalletAddress,amountSol,approveAction,resultAction);
```

## How to build an in-game NFT marketplace?

### What is the NFT Marketplace?

An NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace is a platform that allows users to buy,
sell, and trade NFTs.

### Why should you have your own NFT Marketplace?

There are a few reasons why you might want to have your own NFT marketplace:

1. **Control**: Having your own NFT marketplace allows you to have full control
   over the platform, including the design, features, and policies.
2. **Branding**: By creating your own NFT marketplace, you can establish your
   own brand and create a unique user experience that aligns with your values
   and vision. This can help you stand out in a crowded market and build a loyal
   customer base.
3. **Revenue**: If your NFT marketplace becomes popular and attracts a lot of
   users, you may be able to generate significant revenue through transaction
   fees, advertising, and other sources.
4. **Community**: An NFT marketplace can be a great way to build a community of
   like-minded people who are interested in your work or the types of NFTs you
   offer. This can help you foster relationships with fans and customers and
   create a sense of belonging and connection.

### Scenarios in Mirrors Jump

| ![screen-shot](/docs/images/mj/demo3.gif) | In Mirrors Jump, you can open the NFT Marketplace directly in the game, browse other players' NFTs, and buy NFTs that are on sale. |
